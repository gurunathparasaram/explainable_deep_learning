In this cartoon, the \"missing link\" is not a biological species, but rather a person who appears to be a mix of human and animal. The punchline is that the two individuals being introduced are both human, but one of them is dressed in a suit and tie, representing a \"white-collar worker,\" while the other is covered in fur and standing on all fours, representing a more \"animalistic\" nature. The humor comes from the unexpected twist on the idea of a \"missing link\" and the absurdity of introducing a person who is both human and not human at the same time."}
