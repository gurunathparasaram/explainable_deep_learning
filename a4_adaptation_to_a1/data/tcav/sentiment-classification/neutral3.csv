flood his black hearthstone till its flames expire,
when high i heap it with the weed
the climax of those hopes and duties dear

gnossian his shafts, and lycian was his bow:
you didn't stop for fuss,--
deaf, and dumb, and blind, and cold,
i'm here--so far--and starting on again.
a different man was brother timothy,
see! neptune’s altars minister their brands:
to match your wit against the maker's will,
absently fingering and touching it,

science and song, and all the arts that please;
you turn, o jeanne, on our mystery
a graciousness in giving that doth make
