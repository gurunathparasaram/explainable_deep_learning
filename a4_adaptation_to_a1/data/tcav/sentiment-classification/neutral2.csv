take the warm welcome of new friends with thee,
augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
in some lady's gyahden.
and bow to dread inquisitor and worship lords of dust;
its temples and its palaces did seem
but i, or any demmercrat, feels comf'table to stan' on,
miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;
every day a rich reward will give;
else, suffer’d, it will set the heart on fire,
who, never looking forward, are indeed

among the sources of thy glorious streams,
as when i read in god's own holy book.
and while before me, spotted with white sails,

in the shadow of the shores; as dead leaves wake,
touch it: the marble eyelids are not wet--
oh, say, is he, the eternal, there?
the blessed memory of thy worth
from his own tripod, and his holy tree;

the things it wrought on; i believe
from flight, seditious angel, to receave
what once has been and ne'er shall be again,
sky, marsh, my soul, and yonder sail.
thy merited reward, the first assay
except in france; and when it’s found in france,
for the greek must ask elsewhere.

whatever anybody had
is passed, and our aereal speed suspended.
afar the melancholy thunder moaned,
their hate, and selfishness, and pride!
i would don my hose of homespun gray,
an hundred silken cords are set
i have lost the urban ways.
and sorrowful to-day, thy children set
or by some cabin door, a bush
was freedom's home or glory's grave!
save for a cry that echoes shrill
with its close-curling gold, and love revived.
a golden helm his front and head surrounds
but, through the war-cloud, pray to thee
